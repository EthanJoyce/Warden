#### What is Warden? ####

**Warden is an open source anti-cheat framework for Spigot (and the will be ported over to Sponge (maybe)). It is meant to be flexible with some regards, and highly highly capable. It will fight bugs that NCP does not, and do it better than any paid link out there. Some of these bugs it attacks that others do not are things like XCarry (carrying more items), ForceField/KillAura(to some extent), [and even a exploit to spawn in any item a player would like (bypassing spawn restricitions, and such) originally revealed to the public by the Lead-Developer][llink].**
